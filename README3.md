From call centre agent and not knowing how to code to Software Engineer at Microsoft 
Here is how: 

8 years ago as a call center agent, Goran was working to resolve people’s issues with their phones. He would go to school early in the morning, then off to work right after for an 8 hour shift and taking hundreds of phone calls each day. 

At 12 am he would go home exhausted, but deep down he had a dream to follow. He wanted to be among the best software engineers in the world. So many people doubted him. Why wouldn’t they, he didn’t know how to code at all at this time. 

He was always hungry to learn to reach his dreams. He looked at challenges as something to overcome not as something to make him give up.

He sought guidance and support both off and online. He surrounded himself with highly motivated and smart people.

He would spend weekends and summer holidays teaching himself the basics of coding. Then to different programming languages. 

He once worked for company with a very low paying job that was just covering food expenses, just because he wanted to sit beside their developers and learn how they build websites. 

His main aim was to learn and grow his career, making money wasn't a priority as long as he was making enough to cover his expenses. 

He has put in thousands of hours to reach where he is and knowing him closely I am certain only the sky is the limit.

Most importantly he reached here not by only focusing on his career. He is a great husband and father, and I know from experience a great friend and neighbour as well.

His most important advise to people who are starting their career journey are: 
 
 - Have big dreams
 - Keep learning and always stay curious
 - Be patient
 - Have faith in yourself  yourself especially when next steps are not clear
 - Early in the career choose experience over money

Always have big dreams and work towards them accordingly. People around you may not understand.
